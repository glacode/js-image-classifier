## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Real-time image classification in the browser
- üöÄ No server required - 100% client-side processing
- üß† Powered by TensorFlow.js and MobileNet
- üéØ Accurate classification with confidence percentages
- üîÑ Random image fetching from external source
- üõ°Ô∏è Protected against premature classification attempts

## How It Works

1. Loads MobileNet model in the browser
2. Fetches random images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)
3. Processes images using TensorFlow.js
4. Displays classification results with confidence levels

## Usage

1. Visit the [live demo](https://glacode.github.io/js-image-classifier/)
2. Wait for model initialization (typically 2-3 seconds)
3. Click "Analyze New Image" to classify a random image
4. View results including:
   - Predicted class
   - Confidence percentage
